# System-Verilog-OOP
 This project aims to provide a hands-on experience with System Verilog concepts, focusing on testbench construction within EDA tools. The goal is to verify design functionalities through comprehensive testbenches and gain familiarity in FPGA development tools and hardware description languages.
 
## Description 
  This project consists of eight parts:
  
##Part One
In this part:
 - A main file declares four 8-bit wide logic variables to hold data.
 - The testbench file employs a data control class to manage data, perform assertions for validation, and display data values.

##Part Two
Features:
 - Declaration of four 8-bit wide logic variables in the main file.
 - Implementation of a constructor to initialize data attributes.
 - Testbench initialization of data clear class instances with specific values, followed by assertion checks and data display.
   
##Part Three
Highlights:
 - Declaration of four 8-bit wide logic variables in the main file.
 - Implementation of a constructor within the data control class to initialize attributes.
 - Testbench instantiation of the data control object, assertion verification of data attributes, and display of values.

##Part Four
Involves:
 - Definition of a transaction class in the main file, storing transaction details such as address, checksum, and data.
 - Implementation of methods for displaying transaction details in hexadecimal format and calculating checksum using bitwise operations.
 - Testbench instantiation of a transaction object with predefined values, checksum calculation, and display of transaction details.
   
##Part Five
In this part:
 - Creation of a package named transaction_util to organize related classes and methods.
 - Definition of a class within the package to handle transaction data and checksum calculation.
 - Testbench utilization of automatic program blocks to manage package imports, object instantiation, and method calls.
   
Part Six
Key Features:
 - Use of a package to encapsulate transaction-related definitions.
 - Definition of a class within the package to manage transaction details and checksum calculation.
 - Similar structure to Part Four but organized within a package.
   
##Part Seven
Includes:
 - Creation of a package transaction_util with a transaction class containing static variables.
 - Implementation of constructors and methods for calculating checksum and displaying transaction details.
 - Testbench instantiation of multiple transaction instances with specific data and checksum calculation.
   
Part Eight
Wraps up with:
 - Creation of a package to encapsulate classes and methods.
 - Definition of a configuration class to manage transaction configurations.
 - Implementation of static methods to handle configuration initialization and instance tracking.
